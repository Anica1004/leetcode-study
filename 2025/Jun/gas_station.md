# 🚗 Gas Station Problem: My Thought Process & Final Understanding

## 🧠 My First Approach

* Loop through the gas stations to find a possible start where `gas[i] >= cost[i]`.
* From that start index, simulate the journey with a second loop to check if it's possible to complete the circuit.

### Code Idea (Initial Version)

```python
for i in range(n):
    if gas[i] >= cost[i]:
        # simulate the loop from here
        # check if can go full circle
```

### Thought:

Two loops, but not nested — sequential. So time complexity is still O(n), not O(n^2).

### Example where it passed:

```
gas = [4, 4, 4, 4, 10]
cost = [1, 1, 1, 1, 10]
```

* Starting from station 0:

  * 4 - 1 = 3
  * 3 - 1 = 2
  * 2 - 1 = 1
  * 1 - 1 = 0
  * 0 + 10 - 10 = 0
    ✅ Completes the loop, so answer is 0.

## 🔍 Discovery of a Counter-Example

Test Case:

```python
gas = [5,1,2,3,4]
cost = [4,4,1,5,1]
```

* Expected Output: `4`
* My Code Output: `-1`

🧪 What I Realized:

* My logic fails because it stops too early if the first trial fails.
* There may be a valid start later in the list.
* Need a smarter way to skip stations that definitely won't work.

## ✅ Correct Greedy Solution

### Final Working Code

```python
def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    total_tank = 0
    curr_tank = 0
    start = 0

    for i in range(len(gas)):
        gain = gas[i] - cost[i]
        total_tank += gain
        curr_tank += gain

        if curr_tank < 0:
            start = i + 1
            curr_tank = 0

    return start if total_tank >= 0 else -1
```

## ❓ Important Questions I Asked Along the Way

### 🧪 Why Not Reset total\_tank?

Because we care about total feasibility of the circuit.

Real meaning of `total_tank`:
It's just:

```python
sum(gas[i] - cost[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1
```

If `total_tank < 0` at the end, it’s mathematically impossible to complete the loop, no matter where you start. That’s why:

🔁 `total_tank` is not tied to the current start — it’s checking if a full circuit is even possible.

So even if we restart the local simulation, we must keep adding the total gas-cost difference to `total_tank`.

---

## ✅ Step-by-step Greedy Logic Recap

### 1. Total Feasibility Check

```python
if sum(gas[i] - cost[i]) < 0:
    return -1
```

This is the "do I have enough total gas to make the trip?" check.

If the answer is no, you don’t need to search for a start — no solution is possible.

### 2. Finding the Starting Index

```python
start = 0
curr_tank = 0

for i in range(n):
    gain = gas[i] - cost[i]
    total_tank += gain
    curr_tank += gain

    if curr_tank < 0:
        # can't reach station i+1 from the current start
        start = i + 1  # try next station
        curr_tank = 0  # reset tank
```

### ✅ What I Observed:

* `curr_tank` is used for local reachability (can we keep driving from current start?)
* If `curr_tank` drops below zero → failed mid-trip
* So we restart from next station: `start = i + 1`
* But we don't reset `total_tank` because we're still tracking total fuel balance across the full trip

✅ And yes — the brilliant part is:

* Both checks (`total_tank` and `curr_tank`) are done in a single pass over the array — so the solution stays **O(n)** and clean.

---

## ✅ The Key Insight: Why It's Safe to Skip Intermediate Stations

Let’s say you started from `start = 0`
Now imagine you fail at `i = 3` (i.e., `curr_tank < 0` after station 3)

That means the sum of `gain = gas[j] - cost[j]` from 0 to 3 is negative.

So the whole segment `[0, 3]` is a net loss.

If you tried starting from station 1, 2, or 3 instead:

* You’d still inherit part of that loss.
* Eventually, you’d still run out of gas before reaching `i + 1`.

🧠 This is the greedy algorithm’s golden rule:

> If the total gas between two points is negative, no station in that segment can be the start.

So it's safe — and optimal — to skip them and try `start = i + 1`.

---

## 🧠 Final Summary:

> Separate `total_tank` and `curr_tank`. `total_tank` checks if it's possible at all. `curr_tank` helps find the correct starting index. And instead of two loops, we just use one.
